[1mWhat is Newtrodit?
 
 Newtrodit is a console-based text editor. As Windows doesn't include a console text editor, 
 Newtrodit is probably your best choice. Main goal is your efficency while working.

 [38;2;217;10;3  7;4mSettings[0m
 You may change default parameters by creating a file called 'newtrodit.config'

 Brief explanation of the format:

	Different settings have different names:

	CP (Default code page)
	XS (Console size in columns)
	YS (Console size in lines)

  Format structure:
  The name of the setting and 2 ASCII characters from 0 to 255

  2 ASCII characters represent an unsigned short integer, with values from 0 to 65535.
  Short integer is calculated as follows:
  0xh1 + (255 * 0xh2)

  Where 0xh1 is an hexadecimal value (e.g: 0xe9) and 0xh2 is the other value (e.g: 0xfd, in this case
  the short integer would be 65001 (Unicode codepage))

  Finally, a line feed character (0x0a) is required to jump to the other setting
