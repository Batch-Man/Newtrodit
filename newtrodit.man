 Newtrodit is a console-based text editor. As Windows doesn't include a console text editor, Newtrodit is probably
 your best choice. Main goal is your efficency while working.

 Keyboard shortcuts are very similar to any text editing program

 Keyboard shortcuts are written as follows:

 '[38;2;207;50;68;4m^[0m'     = Control
 '[38;2;207;50;68;4mM-[0m'    = Alt
 '[38;2;207;50;68;4mS-[0m'    = Shift



 Control shortcuts:

 [38;2;207;50;68;4m^A[0m        = Selects all file text (Currently not available)
 [38;2;207;50;68;4m^C[0m        = Copy selected text to clipboard; if no text is selected, copies the whole line
 [38;2;207;50;68;4m^F[0m        = Find string into the file (Currently not working)
 [38;2;207;50;68;4m^G[0m        = Go to a specific line
