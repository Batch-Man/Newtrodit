[1mWhat is Newtrodit?[0m
 
 Newtrodit is a console-based text editor. As Windows doesn't include a console text editor, 
 Newtrodit is probably your best choice. The editor is designed to be minimalistic and easy to use.
 It doesn't use the mouse, and even if it uses only keyboard shortcuts, they're still easy to remember
 due to the fact that they're similar to other text editors.
 Main goal is your efficency when working.

 Settings file must be located in the same directory as Newtrodit with the name '[1mnewtrodit.config[0m'.
 It's a simple text file with one line per setting, with INI-like syntax.

 Comments are allowed in the settings file with the '[38;2;207;50;68m;[0m' (semicolon) character.

 At the moment, Newtrodit has a buffer of $X x $Y, however, it has been found that this limit
 can reach 6615 characters in X position without crashing. It may change depending on the system.
 Newtrodit will crash at more than 1023 lines. This is due to the fact that the buffer is
 a 2D array of characters. This is one of the main issues that Newtrodit has to deal with.

 It has been coded in C to have maximum performance. At the moment it's only compatible with
 Windows because it uses the Windows API to display the GUI.
